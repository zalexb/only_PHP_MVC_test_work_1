Test for v-jet!
You can try it here https://test-vjet.herokuapp.com/;
For installing create mysql database with name "test_vj" 
and import my database dump from "/db_dump/test_vj.sql" to created database.
Or in "/confing/config.php" file comment localhost settings and uncomment heroku settings.
Have fun!
